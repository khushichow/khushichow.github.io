# Serenity Mental Health Resource API

## The Problem and Existing Resources

### The Issue

- Wide target audience

- Search for community and local resources

- Lack of accessibility due to information scattered among several pages

### What's Missing?

- One place that has every resource available

- Easy filtering system

## Our Solution

### Collection

- Scraped the data from resource websites (CAMH) and organized information into categories

### Database

- Created a database of the resource with attributes of how to access it

### API

- Created an open source API that can be added to when more resources appear

## Open Source API

- ፟Anyone can add to this API to add more resources for more people to find

- The categories include ages, disorders, and orientations to make it easier to navigate

- The descriptions are thorough and informative for each resource

- Addresses the fact that the same resource has different locations

- Using GNU General Public License v3.0

## Impact and Importance

- Helps people find resources with little hassle and low stress

- Prevents a time consuming search for something near them and the service they need

- Filters by service type to prevent excessive searching through facilities

## Future Implementation

If we had more time on our hands we would have:

- Information from more organizations and city resources such as community centers, non profit organizations, etc.

- Functional map search to determine what is closest to the user’s location

- Adding more information to each resource such as price, hours of operation, referrals required etc.

- Updated UI/UX and search system
